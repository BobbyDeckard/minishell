Parsing problems:
-	absolute paths are split around the slashes
	=> needed to run commands using their absolute path (which should work even without the paths)
-	arguments containing = are split around the equal
	=> needed to assign variable values with export

Execution problems:
-	cat file | (grep foo && grep bar) leads to a dup2: Bad file descriptor error
	=> closing fd too soon ?
	=> may have somehting to do with the fact I replaced and_pipe and or_pipe by exec_ast

Checks to be sure:
BUILTINS
-	Builtins args and errors
-	Redirs in builtins
-	Leaks in builtins
ERROR MANAGEMENT
-	Error management and leaks on error
-	env_cpy tab is freed 1) at the end of the program, 2) in case of error
-	File error messages
EXECUTION PROCESS
-	Exit status transmission (especially in pipes)

To be implemented:
-	Solo redirs
	=> need to combine no cmd.args[0] verification with a fd verification, if the fd is valid, exit with 0, else exit with 1
-	PWD and OLDPWD values in different scenarios
	=> seems like with env -i bash, OLDPWD exists as a variable but is unset until cd is called
		=> which then seems to mean env only prints assigned variables while export without arguments
		prints unassigned variables too
	=> also seems like export doesn't print the _= variable
		=> it actually does when the env has not been withheld from the bash
		=> rather it prints the variable when it isn't equal to /usr/bin/env
-	Replace macroes by existing ones
-	Exit should free allocated memory ?
-	set pointers to NULL after freeing them to avoid double frees ?
-	Expander
