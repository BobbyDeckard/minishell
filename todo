Parsing problems:
-	absolute paths are split around the slashes
	=> needed to run commands using their absolute path (which should work even without the paths)
-	arguments containing = are split around the equal
	=> needed to assign variable values with export

Execution problems:
-	cat file | (grep foo && grep bar) leads to a dup2: Bad file descriptor error
	=> closing fd too soon ?

Checks to be sure:
-	Builtins args and errors
-	Redirs in builtins
-	Leaks in builtins
-	Error management and leaks on error
-	env_cpy tab is freed 1) at the end of the program, 2) in case of error
-	File error messages
-	Exit status transmission (especially in pipes)

To be implemented:
-	Solo redirs
-	PWD and OLDPWD values in different scenarios
-	Replace macroes by existing ones
-	Expander
